            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my corner of the web!<br />I had my first fateful encounter with code two years ago as a freelance Course Strategist helping clients monetize their knowledge online. I love acquiring and applying knowledge, particularly when I can use it to solve problems and improve processes, so after learning HTML and CSS, it didn't take me long to realize that the world of Tech could deliver me a never ending supply of this!<br />Having now completed She Codes Plus, an incredible initiative aiming to address the gender imbalance in the industry, whilst completing concurrent studies in data analytics, I'm eager to build innovative solutions and solve complex programming problems as a software developer.</p>
